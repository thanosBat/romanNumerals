Roman Numerals
===============

This Maven project consists of a class that implements
the following interface:

public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {

    public String generate(int number);

}

and the test suit that designed in order to develop the class.

The generate method converts the Arabic numerals, from 1 to 3999, 
into Roman ones.
For the development of the class I followed a test driven development 
approach.
